    "From the experiment results, it is evident that in the test group, which had access to the Newsfeed, the average time between the first commit and the deadline of the lab assignments increased after visiting the Newsfeed. The average time before visiting the Newsfeed was 60.56 hours, while after visiting, it was 103.41 hours. This suggests that access to the Newsfeed might have encouraged students to start working on the lab assignments earlier.\n",

    "In the control group, which did not have access to the Newsfeed, the average time also increased, but not as significantly. The average time before the Newsfeed was 99.46 hours, and after, it was 112.71 hours. This could be because the control group lacked the stimulus of the Newsfeed, so the changes were not as substantial.\n",
